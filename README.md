## Welcome to my small practice! ðŸ‘‹

## Overview
=> It's a solution for a [Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U/) that I did to practice my handling of tailwind CSS because probably I'll use this CSS framework in my upcoming adventures in React.
